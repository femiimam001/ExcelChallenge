# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

In this project, i shall be helping an up-coming playright **Louise** . She wants to start a **crowdfunding campaign** to help fund her play **FEVER** .
She has estimated a budget of over ten thousand dollars and was very hesitant in jumping into her first fund raising campaign.This project will include the use of power excel to organise,sort and analyse crowdfunding data. Using excel to analyse current site data will help her gain a greater understanding of campaign from start to finish and she will be able to set her campagn to mirror other succcessful ones in the same category.

### Purpose

This project involve the use of excel power funtions and calculation to determine wether there are specific factors that make a project campaign succesful or fail. We will use this insight help Louise to set her self up for success.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Pivot tables and pivot lines charts were used in detremining the outcome based on lunch dates and are extremely versatile and powerful tools. They allow us to pick and choose the data we want to analyze and then tweak it with visual customizations. Pivot tables also let us continue to tweak the view by filtering our chosen data after it's been set to the line graph. to show outcomes based on trends.

The following steps were taken in determining the outcome based on launch date line graph:

-Convert Unix Timestamps to Readable Format

-Create a New Pivot Chart

-Rename the new sheet "Outcomes Based on Launch Date."

-Right-click the chart image and hover over "Change Chart Type."

-Select "Line" from the pop-up menu.

-Select the "Line with Markers" chart type from the next pop-up menu.

Looking at our new chart, it shows the months of May and June both have a greater success rate:

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Using Excel skills to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.We would need to use a new function, COUNTIFS(), to collect the outcome and goal data for the “plays” subcategory.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
